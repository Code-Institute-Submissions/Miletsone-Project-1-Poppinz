**Poppinz Parties****\
**

The purpose of this project is firstly to fulfil the criteria of the first Milestone project, but more importantly, to produce stronger, on-line presence for my friend's business, "Poppinz Parties".  As the name suggests, Poppinz provide a children's party, entertainment service.  They have a strong presence on social media, but require a website to serve as a hub for their videos, photos and reviews.  They also need to access new customers and develop their brand.

**Who is the website for?**

Initially, the intended users will be parents who wish to provide an enjoyable and memorable party experience for their children and their children's friends.

To this end, the homepage will need to instantly convey the nature of the business (i.e. it will have to have pictorial elements and facets that convey the "fun" nature of the service, the fonts and background colours will need to reflect this.)  But this must be balanced by the fact that the primary users are going to be adults- the feel of the website must not be too puerile and it must still have functional navigation and appealing sections.  

The unique appeal of the service and its high quality must be instantly conveyed also- pictures of previous parties & reviews from previous customers (which are already accessible from social media and are very positive) should therefore be prominent as soon as the user arrives at the site.

Eventually, the site will also provide a base for Poppinz proposed on-line party services.  

The coronavirus lock-down has a had a hugely detrimental effect on the business. In an attempt to counteract the loss of business that has already occurred and the future impact of social distancing regulations, the business owner has already held a few live streamed, party entertainment sessions via social media platforms.  

We envisage that these can be accessed directly from the website via some form of portal (yet to be decided)  

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
