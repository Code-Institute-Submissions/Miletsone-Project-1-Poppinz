**Poppinz Parties****\
**

The purpose of this project is firstly to fulfil the criteria of the first Milestone project, but more importantly, to produce stronger, on-line presence for my friend's business, "Poppinz Parties".  As the name suggests, Poppinz provide a children's party, entertainment service.  They have a strong presence on social media, but require a website to serve as a hub for their videos, photos and reviews.  They also need to access new customers and develop their brand.

[](#ux)**UX**

**Who is the website for?**

Initially, the intended users will be parents who wish to provide an enjoyable and memorable party experience for their children and their children's friends.

To this end, the homepage will need to instantly convey the nature of the business (i.e. it will have to have pictorial elements and facets that convey the "fun" nature of the service, the fonts and background colours will need to reflect this.)  But this must be balanced by the fact that the primary users are going to be adults- the feel of the website must not be too puerile and it must still have functional navigation and appealing sections.  

The unique appeal of the service and its high quality must be instantly conveyed also- pictures of previous parties & reviews from previous customers (which are already accessible from social media and are very positive) should therefore be prominent as soon as the user arrives at the site.

Eventually, the site will also provide a base for Poppinz proposed on-line party services.  

The coronavirus lock-down has a had a hugely detrimental effect on the business. In an attempt to counteract the loss of business that has already occurred and the future impact of social distancing regulations, the business owner has already held a few live streamed, party entertainment sessions via social media platforms.  

We envisage that these can be accessed directly from the website via some form of portal (yet to be decided)  

[](#features)**Features**
-------------------------

### [](#existing-features)**Existing Features**

- Homepage (index.html) - a simple intro to the business which provides clear contact details in the header and an easily utilised navbar, with links to the four pages.  Social media icons from Font Awesome have also been included in both the headser & footer and have been linked to the business' pages.  A set of three "bootstrap cards" enables the potential customer to instantly get a feel for the type of services provided by Lisa & her team. Underneath this is a carousel of images whic will need to be updated and added to at the business' discretion.  The footer contains links to the pages and further contact info and utilises the same font and text colour as is evident in the header and cards.

- parties.html & team.html, employ the same header & footer that our evident in the homepage and also utilise Bootstrap cards to present pictorial and textual info.

- The contact page is a simple form that requests the use to provide personal details and prompts them to suggest which type of children's party the are interested in.  I quite honestly haven't got a clue about how the back-end aspect will work, but I envisage that the messages will be be forwarded to the customer's personal email, so she can gain easy access to them (via her smartphone for e.g.) and respond instantly.

### [](#features-left-to-implement)**Features Left to Implement**

- This site will soon be launched live, and I plan to add to it incrementally.  A domain name has been purchased ([http://www.poppinzparties.co.uk/](http://www.poppinzparties.co.uk/?fbclid=IwAR2kS2kmw-mY3n-IV3M-jUf0y_4A_uBL5lKMoF9Xn8esZfM1uTjgJgoC2vM)) and this will hopefully be used to have the site live by September 2020.

- The business owner has requested several other functions she would like added to the website; these include-

- a section where pdf or similar documents pertaining to health & safety (with particular reference to covid-19 policies) can be downloaded and perused by potential customers.

- A section of the website than enables customer to login to gain access to on-lineparties, which may be linked to a Zoom or Skype account.

- A "testimonials" page, where positive reviews by customers on Facebook, Google etc can be accessed

- A VLOG facility to which videos can be simply uploaded by the customer, regularly.  This may involve linking to a YouTube account, which could then be embedded within the site.

- A "Kids Fun" section, to encourage "after sales" Interaction to enable the owner to maintain interest in the website and keep in contact with customers.  A mailing list should hopefully also be added.

[](#technologies-used)**Technologies Used**
-------------------------------------------

- HTML5 & CSS 3

o These langauges were used as they are industry standard and are all I'm familiar with!

- Bootstrap 4

o One of the demands of this project was to make a mobile first, device responsive site. Bootstrap performs much of the necessary alteration needed for the site to work on multiple screen sizes, without resorting to typing pages of CSS.  

- GTHUB &GITPOD

o The project was coded using Gitpod and the repository created in and shared via Github.  As an inexperienced coder, these are the only types I am familiar with

- Balsamiq &Pencil Project\
[https://balsamiq.com/ ](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAjwm_P5BRAhEiwAwRzSO9XZ4C13TRwTQTKvtW3ykXP5EHBTwc91hH3H7ZysMgp9CQn7iLZEPxoCjDUQAvD_BwE)    <https://pencil.evolus.vn/>

o Again, as someone brand new to web design, I was advised to try "Balsamiq" to create wireframes for the project.  This was fine for the homepage, but due to lock-,down my free trial expired before I could utilise it for the rest of the site.  Pencil Projects was an effective and echonomically viable (i.e. free) alternative.

[](#testing)**Testing**
-----------------------

As an inexperienced coder, my testing took the form of basically trying out the sit one various devices and using two different browsers.  I am satisfied with how it appears and functions on smart phone and laptop size screens but have struggled with getting everything to appear correctly on a tablet sized screen.  Time constraints have prevented me form solving this issue, but it is certainly something I will have fixed before the site goes live.

The contact form seems to work correctly, or as well it can from a static website-  error messages do appear if a section of the form isn't completed or if an email address is entered without the correct format.

The project will be be deployed via GIthub.
